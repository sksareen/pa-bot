So at first I wanted to make this as a WhatsApp bot but after going through the process of setting up a Twilio account and then finding out I need a phone number to do that, which I had, and even added $20 to the phone account, and also $20 to my Twilio account, I still had to figure out WhatsApp Business account setup, Meta Business Manager, and then a whole other can of worms. That part was just too much. The cost was one thing, but the time investment and complexity was another.

So I started thinking about other options. Discord? Slack? Telegram? Email? Texting? While they were appealing, a key aspect was that it had to work for me first. I need something that was going to be reliable, and I need something that I would use, and ideally something that my target audience would use.

So let's use X.
